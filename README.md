# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Esteban

Hello! I'm Esteban, and I'm on an exciting journey into the world of software development. I am currently enrolled in San Diego State University's Software Development bootcamp, which is teaching me some cool things about the world of computer science.

## Technologies I've Learned/Been Introduced To ðŸ“š

I have experience with various technologies related to software development:

- **Web Development**: I've learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently diving into React and Redux for building interactive web applications.
- **Backend Development**: I'm exploring the world of backend development using technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create robust server-side applications.
- **APIs**: I've started to understand how to build and use APIs to connect different parts of web applications.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

I'm actively expanding my skills, and here are some of the things I'm currently focused on:

- **SQL and PostgreSQL**: I'm currently learning about relational databases and SQL, with a focus on PostgreSQL.
- **Bootcamp Projects**: Most of my repositories contain class-related assignments, some are related to projects and exercises from my bootcamp, where I'm applying what I've learned.
