# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Esteban

Hello! I'm Esteban, and I'm on an exciting journey into the world of software development. I am currenlty enrolled in San Diego State University's Software Development bootcamp that's teaching me some cool things about the world of computer science.

## ðŸ‘€ Interests

I have a growing interest in various aspects of software development, including:

- **Web Development**: I've learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently diving into React and Redux for building interactive web applications.
- **Backend Development**: I'm exploring the world of backend development using technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create server-side applications.
- **APIs**: I've started to understand how to build and use APIs to connect different parts of web applications.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

I'm actively expanding my skills, and here are some of the things I'm currently learning and practicing:

- **React and Redux**: I'm deep into learning how to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces using React and state management with Redux.

## ðŸ“š About My Repositories

- I primarily use GitHub to store, showcase, and ultimatley turn in my work from my Software Development bootcamp. While most of my repositories are related to school assignments and projects, I'm gradually expanding my portfolio to include personal projects and experiments as I continue to learn.
